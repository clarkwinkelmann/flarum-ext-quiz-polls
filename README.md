This extension allows turning polls created with the FriendsOfFlarum Polls extension into Quizzes.

It's very simple and there are definitely ways to "cheat" and find the answer before voting.

When a poll is in quiz mode, an additional class `.Poll--quiz` is placed on the container.
The answers have a `.PollOption--correct` and `.PollOption--wrong` classes added after the user voted.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-quizz-polls

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
